- 👋 Hi, I’m @Tnow2023
- 👀 I’m interested in technology and I am facinated by the way it has evolved over the years. I also enjoy local history, 3D modeling/redering, fishing, hiking, and learning to code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript 
- 💞️ I’m looking to understand coding more and learn as much as I can to eventually get into a career as a Software Engineer.
- 📫 How to reach me ...
